# Agent Development Lifecycle (ADLC) - Python SDK Implementation

This folder contains a complete implementation of the Agent Development Lifecycle using the Salesforce Python SDK, demonstrating all five phases of agent development from ideation to monitoring.

## Overview

The Agent Development Lifecycle (ADLC) is a structured framework for developing AI agents that encompasses five critical phases. This implementation uses the Salesforce Python SDK (`agentforce-sdk`) to create, test, deploy, and monitor production-ready AI agents.

## The Agent Development Lifecycle

### Phase 1: Ideation & Design
**Purpose**: Define the agent's purpose, persona, and core capabilities through structured ideation.

**Implementation**:
- Interactive agent specification collection
- AI-powered topic generation based on company type
- Complete agent JSON with metadata and topics
- Python SDK compatible specification generation

**Output**: `agent_spec.json` - Complete agent specification ready for development

### Phase 2: Development
**Purpose**: Build agent with core functionality using Salesforce Python SDK.

**Implementation**:
- Salesforce SDK integration with authentication
- Real agent creation in Salesforce org
- Tools and knowledge base implementation
- Centralized credential management

**Key Features**:
- Uses `agentforce-sdk` for agent creation
- Implements `Action` classes for tools
- Centralized authentication for all phases
- Real agent deployment (not mock)

### Phase 3: Testing & Validation
**Purpose**: Ensure agent quality, security, and performance using Salesforce Testing API.

**Implementation**:
- **Salesforce Testing API Integration**: Uses `AiEvaluationDefinition` metadata type
- **Comprehensive Test Suites**: Guest Services, Employee Management, Revenue Optimization
- **Multi-Dimensional Testing**: Utterances, context variables, conversation history
- **Quality Metrics**: Accuracy, empathy, relevance, conciseness
- **Connect API Integration**: Test execution and detailed reports

**Output Files**:
- `ConversationFlow_Tests.xml`
- `CustomerService_Tests.xml`
- `EmployeeManagement_Tests.xml`
- `GuestServices_Tests.xml`
- `ReservationManagement_Tests.xml`
- `RevenueOptimization_Tests.xml`

### Phase 4: Deployment & Release
**Purpose**: Deploy the validated agent to production Salesforce environment.

**Implementation**:
- Automated deployment using `agentforce-sdk`
- Real agent creation in Salesforce org
- Deployment verification
- Builder UI integration

**Output Files**:
- `package.xml` - Salesforce deployment package
- `agent_deployment_metadata.json` - Deployment metadata
- `agentforce_deployments/` - Complete deployment artifacts

### Phase 5: Monitoring & Tuning
**Purpose**: Monitor agent performance and continuously optimize through data-driven insights.

**Implementation**:
- **Enhanced Observability**: Comprehensive monitoring class
- **Multi-Dimensional Metrics**: Response time, success rate, user satisfaction
- **Performance Dashboards**: Matplotlib and Plotly visualizations
- **Trace Management**: Execution traces with severity levels
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Radar charts, heatmaps, gauge charts
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Detailed observability reports

**Output Files**:
- `agent_performance_data.csv` - Performance metrics
- `agent_test_report.txt` - Test execution report
- `monitoring_config.json` - Monitoring configuration
- `agent_enhanced_dashboard.png` - Enhanced dashboard
- `agent_performance_dashboard.png` - Performance dashboard
- `observability_report.json` - Observability report
- `phase5_monitoring_dashboard.png` - Phase 5 dashboard
