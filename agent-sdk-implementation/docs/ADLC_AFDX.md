# Agent Development Lifecycle (ADLC) with Agentforce DX

This document provides a comprehensive implementation of the Agent Development Lifecycle using Salesforce Agentforce DX (AFDX) - the pro-code approach to agent development.

## Overview

Agentforce DX extends Salesforce Developer Experience (DX) tools to work with agents, enabling modern DevOps practices for agent development. This implementation covers all five phases of the ADLC using Agentforce DX commands and best practices.

## Prerequisites

- Salesforce Developer Edition org with Agentforce enabled
- Salesforce CLI (latest version)
- Visual Studio Code with Salesforce Extensions
- Git for version control

## Phase 1: Ideation & Design

### Mission Statement
Design a resort manager agent for Coral Cloud Resorts that handles customer complaints, manages employee schedules, and ensures smooth resort operations.

### Design Decisions
- **Agent Type**: Customer-facing service agent
- **Persona**: Helpful and professional conversational tone
- **Company**: Coral Cloud Resorts
- **Core Capabilities**: 
  - Customer complaint resolution
  - Employee schedule management
  - Resort policy knowledge
  - Reservation assistance

### Agentforce DX Implementation

#### Step 1: Generate Agent Specification

The first step in the pro-code journey is to generate an `agentSpec.yaml` file using the Salesforce CLI:

```bash
# Navigate to your DX project directory
cd agentforcedx

# Generate agent specification interactively
sf agent generate agent-spec
```

**Interactive Prompts:**
```
Type of agent: Customer
Company Name: Coral Cloud Resorts
Company Description: Coral Cloud Resorts provides customers with exceptional destination activities, unforgettable experiences, and reservation services, all backed by a commitment to top-notch customer service.
Role of the agent: The resort manager fields customer complaints, manages employee schedules, and generally makes sure everything is working smoothly.
```

#### Step 2: Review Generated Specification

The command creates an `agentSpec.yaml` file in your DX project's `specs` directory:

```yaml
# specs/agentSpec.yaml
name: "Coral Cloud Resorts Resort Manager"
description: "The resort manager fields customer complaints, manages employee schedules, and generally makes sure everything is working smoothly."
agentType: "Customer"
companyName: "Coral Cloud Resorts"
companyDescription: "Coral Cloud Resorts provides customers with exceptional destination activities, unforgettable experiences, and reservation services, all backed by a commitment to top-notch customer service."
topics:
  - name: "Customer Complaints"
    description: "Handle and resolve customer complaints about services, accommodations, or experiences"
  - name: "Employee Scheduling"
    description: "Manage and update employee work schedules and shift assignments"
  - name: "Reservation Management"
    description: "Assist with booking modifications, cancellations, and special requests"
  - name: "Resort Policies"
    description: "Provide information about resort policies, rules, and procedures"
  - name: "Activity Recommendations"
    description: "Suggest activities and experiences based on guest preferences"
  - name: "Emergency Response"
    description: "Handle urgent situations and coordinate emergency procedures"
```

#### Step 3: Refine the Specification

Edit the `agentSpec.yaml` file to add more specific topics and capabilities:

```yaml
# Enhanced agentSpec.yaml
name: "Coral Cloud Resorts Resort Manager"
description: "The resort manager fields customer complaints, manages employee schedules, and generally makes sure everything is working smoothly."
agentType: "Customer"
companyName: "Coral Cloud Resorts"
companyDescription: "Coral Cloud Resorts provides customers with exceptional destination activities, unforgettable experiences, and reservation services, all backed by a commitment to top-notch customer service."
topics:
  - name: "Customer Complaints"
    description: "Handle and resolve customer complaints about services, accommodations, or experiences"
  - name: "Employee Scheduling"
    description: "Manage and update employee work schedules and shift assignments"
  - name: "Reservation Management"
    description: "Assist with booking modifications, cancellations, and special requests"
  - name: "Resort Policies"
    description: "Provide information about resort policies, rules, and procedures"
  - name: "Activity Recommendations"
    description: "Suggest activities and experiences based on guest preferences"
  - name: "Emergency Response"
    description: "Handle urgent situations and coordinate emergency procedures"
  - name: "Room Service"
    description: "Coordinate room service requests and housekeeping needs"
  - name: "Guest Services"
    description: "Provide general assistance and information to guests"
  - name: "Maintenance Issues"
    description: "Report and coordinate resolution of maintenance problems"
  - name: "Special Events"
    description: "Coordinate special events and celebrations for guests"
```

#### Step 4: Validate the Specification

```bash
# Validate the agent specification
sf agent validate agent-spec --spec-file specs/agentSpec.yaml
```

### Phase 1 Deliverables

1. **agentSpec.yaml** - Complete agent specification with topics
2. **Design Documentation** - Clear mission, persona, and capabilities
3. **Topic Definitions** - AI-generated topics that define agent capabilities

### Best Practices for Phase 1

- **Be Specific**: Define clear, actionable topics
- **Consider Edge Cases**: Include emergency and maintenance scenarios
- **Align with Business Goals**: Ensure topics support business objectives
- **Review and Iterate**: Refine topics based on stakeholder feedback

---

## Phase 2: Development

### Overview
Transform the agent specification into a functional agent using Agentforce DX development tools.

### Agentforce DX Implementation

#### Step 1: Create Agent from Specification

```bash
# Create agent from the specification file
sf agent create --spec-file specs/agentSpec.yaml
```

#### Step 2: Review Generated Agent Metadata

The command creates agent metadata in your DX project:

```
force-app/main/default/agents/
├── Coral_Cloud_Resorts_Resort_Manager.agent-meta.xml
├── topics/
│   ├── Customer_Complaints.topic-meta.xml
│   ├── Employee_Scheduling.topic-meta.xml
│   └── ...
└── actions/
    ├── HandleComplaint.action-meta.xml
    ├── UpdateSchedule.action-meta.xml
    └── ...
```

#### Step 3: Customize Agent Actions

Edit the generated action files to add custom logic:

```xml
<!-- actions/HandleComplaint.action-meta.xml -->
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<CustomObject xmlns="http://soap.sforce.com/2006/04/metadata">
    <label>Handle Customer Complaint</label>
    <description>Processes and resolves customer complaints</description>
    <type>Flow</type>
    <flowDefinition>
        <!-- Flow definition for complaint handling -->
    </flowDefinition>
</CustomObject>
```

#### Step 4: Add Custom Apex Classes

Create custom Apex classes for complex business logic:

```apex
// force-app/main/default/classes/ResortManagerController.cls
public with sharing class ResortManagerController {
    @AuraEnabled
    public static String handleComplaint(String complaintDetails) {
        // Custom logic for complaint handling
        return 'Complaint processed successfully';
    }
    
    @AuraEnabled
    public static String updateEmployeeSchedule(String employeeId, String newSchedule) {
        // Custom logic for schedule updates
        return 'Schedule updated successfully';
    }
}
```

### Phase 2 Deliverables

1. **Agent Metadata** - Complete agent definition with topics and actions
2. **Custom Actions** - Business logic for each agent capability
3. **Apex Classes** - Custom code for complex operations
4. **Flow Definitions** - Visual workflow for agent actions
