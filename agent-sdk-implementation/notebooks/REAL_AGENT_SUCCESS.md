## What Was Fixed

### Problem 1: Missing 'scope' Field Error
**Error**: `KeyError: 'scope'`

**Root Cause**: The SDK's `Topic` class requires a `scope` field for each topic, but our agent specification didn't include it.

**Solution**: Added `scope: "public"` to all 5 topics in `agent_spec_sdk.json`

### Problem 2: Agent Object Creation
**Issue**: `AgentUtils.create_agent_from_file()` was having parsing issues

**Solution**: Used `AgentUtils.create_agent_from_dict()` which provides better control over the data
