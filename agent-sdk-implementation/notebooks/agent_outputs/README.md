## File Organization

Each phase folder contains:
- **Output files** generated during that phase
- **README.md** explaining the files and their purpose
- **Clear documentation** of what each file contains

## Usage

1. **Navigate to specific phase folder** for phase-specific outputs
2. **Read README.md** in each folder for detailed information
3. **Use files as needed** for deployment, testing, or monitoring
4. **Maintain organization** by keeping files in their respective phase folders

## Maintenance

- **Keep files organized** by phase
- **Update README files** when adding new outputs
- **Clean up old files** regularly
- **Document new file types** as they are added
