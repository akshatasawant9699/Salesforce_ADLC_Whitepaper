        "\n",
        "**Phase 1: Ideation & Design**\n",
        "- Collect user input for agent ideation\n",
        "- Generate agent specification JSON file\n",
        "- Create agent-sdk compatible input\n",
        "\n",
        "**Phase 2: Development**\n",
        "- Clone and setup agent-sdk repository\n",
        "- Create agent with tools and knowledge base\n",
        "- Implement agent functionality\n",
        "\n",
        "**Phase 3: Testing & Validation**\n",
        "- Unit testing for individual functions\n",
        "- End-to-end conversation simulation\n",
        "- Adversarial testing for security\n",
        "- Performance and load testing\n",
        "\n",
        "**Phase 4: Deployment & Release**\n",
        "- Deploy agent to Salesforce using Agentforce DX\n",
        "- Open agent in Agentforce Builder UI\n",
        "- Manage agent metadata and version control\n",
        "\n",
        "## Usage\n",
