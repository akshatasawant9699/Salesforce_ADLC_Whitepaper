# Agent Specification Fix - 'scope' Field

## Issue
When attempting to create an agent from the specification, the following error occurred:
```
WARNING: Failed to create agent from JSON: 'scope'
```

## Root Cause
The `agent_spec.json` file was missing the required `scope` field, which is mandatory for the Salesforce Agentforce SDK.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated `agent_spec.json`
Added the missing `scope` field with value `"public"`:

```json
{
  "name": "Coral Cloud Resorts Resort Manager",
  "description": "The resort manager fields customer complaints, manages employee schedules, and generally ensures that all processes are running smoothly for Coral Cloud Resorts",
  "agent_type": "External",
  "scope": "public",  // ✅ ADDED THIS FIELD
  "company_name": "Coral Cloud Resorts",
  "company_description": "...",
  "role": "Resort Operations Manager",
  "tone": "professional and friendly",
  "topics": [...]
}
```

### 2. Updated Notebook Phase 1 Code
Modified the agent JSON generation in the notebook to always include the `scope` field:

```python
agent_json = {
    "name": f"{company_name} Resort Manager",
    "description": f"{agent_role} for {company_name}",
    "agent_type": "External",
    "scope": "public",  # ✅ ADDED THIS FIELD
    "company_name": company_name,
    "company_description": company_description,
    "role": agent_role,
    "tone": tone,
    "topics": topics
}
```

### 3. Additional Improvements
- Fixed grammar in description (removed duplicate text)
- Clarified role field
- Improved tone description

## Required Fields for Agent Specification

The following fields are **required** for Salesforce Agentforce SDK:

1. ✅ `name` - Agent name
2. ✅ `description` - Agent description
3. ✅ `agent_type` - "Internal" or "External"
4. ✅ `scope` - "public" or "private"
5. ✅ `company_name` - Company name
6. ✅ `company_description` - Company description
7. ✅ `role` - Agent role/purpose
8. ✅ `tone` - Conversational tone
9. ✅ `topics` - Array of topic objects with name and description

## Validation Results

After the fix, all required fields are present:

```
✅ name: Coral Cloud Resorts Resort Manager
✅ description: The resort manager fields customer complaints...
✅ agent_type: External
✅ scope: public
✅ company_name: Coral Cloud Resorts
✅ company_description: Coral Cloud Resorts provides customers...
✅ role: Resort Operations Manager
✅ tone: professional and friendly
✅ topics: 5 topics defined
```

## Scope Field Options

The `scope` field accepts two values:

- **`"public"`**: Agent is accessible to external users (customers, partners)
- **`"private"`**: Agent is for internal use only (employees, internal systems)

For the Resort Manager Agent, we use `"public"` since it handles customer complaints and guest services.

## Next Steps

The agent specification is now valid and ready for:
1. ✅ Phase 2: Development with Salesforce SDK
2. ✅ Phase 3: Testing & Validation
3. ✅ Phase 4: Deployment to Salesforce org
4. ✅ Phase 5: Monitoring & Tuning

## Prevention

To prevent this error in the future:
1. Always include the `scope` field when creating agent specifications
2. Use the validation script to check specifications before deployment
3. Refer to the Salesforce Agentforce SDK documentation for required fields
4. The notebook Phase 1 code now automatically includes this field

## Status
✅ **RESOLVED** - Agent specification is now complete and valid
