# Agent Development Lifecycle (ADLC) Implementation

This repository provides a comprehensive implementation of the Agent Development Lifecycle using both the Salesforce Python SDK and Agentforce DX approaches for creating, testing, and deploying AI agents.

## Overview

The Agent Development Lifecycle (ADLC) is a structured framework for developing AI agents that encompasses five critical phases: Ideation & Design, Development, Testing & Validation, Deployment & Release, and Monitoring & Tuning.

## Implementation Approaches

### Python SDK Implementation
- **Interactive Development**: Jupyter notebook-based implementation
- **Python SDK**: Uses `agentforce-sdk` for agent creation and management
- **Data Cloud Integration**: Performance monitoring and analytics
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Quick iteration and testing

### Agentforce DX Implementation
- **Pro-Code Development**: CLI-based agent development
- **Version Control**: Git integration for agent metadata
- **CI/CD Integration**: Automated deployment pipelines
- **Enterprise Ready**: Production-grade development practices

## Quick Start

### Python SDK Implementation

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Notebook**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook notebooks/ADLC_PythonSDK.ipynb
   ```

3. **Configure Credentials**
   - Update placeholder credentials in the notebook
   - Ensure you have agentforce-sdk access

### Agentforce DX Implementation

1. **Install Salesforce CLI**
   ```bash
   npm install -g @salesforce/cli
   sf update
   ```

2. **Create DX Project**
   ```bash
   sf project generate --name agentforcedx
   cd agentforcedx
   ```

3. **Authorize Org**
   ```bash
   sf org login web --alias agentforce
   ```

4. **Follow the Complete Guide**
   - See `ADLC_AFDX.md` for detailed implementation of all 5 phases

## Requirements

### Python SDK Implementation
- Python 3.9+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Salesforce org with Agentforce enabled
- agentforce-sdk package

### Agentforce DX Implementation
- Salesforce CLI (latest version)
- Visual Studio Code with Salesforce Extensions
- Salesforce Developer Edition org with Agentforce enabled
- Git for version control

## The Agent Development Lifecycle

### Phase 1: Ideation & Design
Define the agent's purpose, persona, and core capabilities.

### Phase 2: Development
Transform specifications into functional agents with tools and knowledge base.

### Phase 3: Testing & Validation
Comprehensive testing to validate behavior, security, and performance.

### Phase 4: Deployment & Release
Deploy agents to target environments with proper validation.

### Phase 5: Monitoring & Tuning
Monitor performance and optimize based on real-world usage data.
