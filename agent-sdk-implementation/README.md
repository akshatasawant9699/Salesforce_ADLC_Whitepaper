## Features

### Phase 1: Ideation & Design
- Interactive agent specification generation
- Company and role-based topic generation
- JSON specification creation compatible with agentforce-sdk

### Phase 2: Development
- Agent creation using Salesforce Python SDK
- Enhanced resort manager capabilities
- Advanced features including:
  - Weather-based activity recommendations
  - Revenue optimization
  - Guest satisfaction analytics
  - Reservation management
  - Employee scheduling
  - Complaint handling

## Quick Start

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Notebook**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook notebooks/ADLC_PythonSDK.ipynb
   ```

3. **Configure Credentials**
   - Replace placeholder credentials in the notebook with your Salesforce credentials
   - Ensure you have agentforce-sdk access

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Salesforce org with Agentforce enabled
- agentforce-sdk package

## Usage

The notebook provides a complete implementation of the Agent Development Lifecycle:

1. **Phase 1**: Collect agent requirements and generate specification
2. **Phase 2**: Create and deploy agent with enhanced capabilities

## Advanced Features

- **Weather Integration**: Context-aware activity recommendations
- **Revenue Optimization**: Dynamic pricing based on demand
- **Analytics**: Guest satisfaction analysis and insights
- **Knowledge Base**: Resort policies and procedures
- **Tools**: Comprehensive resort management functions

## Security

- No credentials are stored in the repository
- Use environment variables or secure credential management
- All sensitive data is excluded via .gitignore

## Documentation

See `WHITEPAPER.md` for detailed implementation documentation.
