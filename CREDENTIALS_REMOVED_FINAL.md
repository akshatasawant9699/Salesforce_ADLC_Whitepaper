## Next Steps

### 1. Force Push to GitHub (REQUIRED)

```bash
cd /Users/akshata.sawant/SF_ADLC_Whitepaper
git push origin main --force
```

⚠️ **Warning**: This will overwrite the remote repository history. Anyone who has cloned the repo will need to re-clone it.

### 2. Rotate Credentials (CRITICAL)

**Immediately change the exposed credentials:**

1. **Change Salesforce Password**
   - Log into Salesforce
   - Go to Settings > My Personal Information > Change My Password
   - Change from: `Ambadnya@9699` to a new strong password

2. **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
   - Go to Settings > My Personal Information > Multi-Factor Authentication
   - Enable Salesforce Authenticator or another MFA method

3. **Review Login History**
   - Go to Setup > Login History
   - Check for any unauthorized access
   - Look for suspicious IP addresses or locations

4. **Reset Security Token** (if needed)
   - Go to Settings > My Personal Information > Reset My Security Token
   - A new token will be emailed to you

### 3. Verify on GitHub

After force pushing:
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Check the files for credentials
3. Review the commit history
4. Confirm all credentials are gone

## How to Use the Notebook Now

### Update Credentials

In the notebook, replace the placeholders with your actual credentials:

```python
# Cell 6 (Phase 2) and Cell 12 (Phase 4)
username = "your_username@example.com"  # Replace with your Salesforce username
password = "your_password"              # Replace with your Salesforce password
security_token = ""                     # Add if required
```

### Best Practices Going Forward

1. **Never commit credentials to git**
2. **Use environment variables**:
   ```python
   import os
   username = os.getenv('SALESFORCE_USERNAME')
   password = os.getenv('SALESFORCE_PASSWORD')
   ```

3. **Use .env files** (add to .gitignore):
   ```bash
   # .env
   SALESFORCE_USERNAME=your_username@example.com
   SALESFORCE_PASSWORD=your_password
   ```

4. **Clear outputs before committing**:
   ```bash
   # In Jupyter: Kernel > Restart & Clear Output
   ```

## Important Notes

### About Git History

Even though we've rewritten the git history locally, the old history still exists on GitHub until you force push. This means:

1. **The credentials are still visible on GitHub** until you force push
2. **Anyone who has cloned the repo** has the old history with credentials
3. **GitHub may have cached versions** that take time to purge

### About Force Push

When you force push:
- The remote history will be overwritten
- Old commits with credentials will be removed from GitHub
- Collaborators will need to re-clone the repository
- You cannot undo this action

### About Credential Rotation

The exposed credentials should be considered compromised. Even after removing them from git:
- They were publicly visible
- They may have been cached or indexed
- Someone may have copied them
- **You must rotate them immediately**

## Support

If you need help:
1. Review `SECURITY_CLEANUP.md` for detailed information
2. Check Salesforce documentation for password reset
3. Contact Salesforce support if you suspect unauthorized access
