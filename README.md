# Agent Development Lifecycle (ADLC) Implementation

This repository provides a comprehensive implementation of the Agent Development Lifecycle using both the Salesforce Python SDK and Agentforce DX approaches for creating, testing, and deploying AI agents.

## Overview

The Agent Development Lifecycle (ADLC) is a structured framework for developing AI agents that encompasses five critical phases: Ideation & Design, Development, Testing & Validation, Deployment & Release, and Monitoring & Tuning. This implementation demonstrates both programmatic (Python SDK) and pro-code (Agentforce DX) approaches to agent development.

## Implementation Approaches

### Python SDK Implementation
- **Interactive Development**: Jupyter notebook-based implementation
- **Python SDK**: Uses `agentforce-sdk` for agent creation and management
- **Data Cloud Integration**: Performance monitoring and analytics
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Quick iteration and testing
- **Observability**: Comprehensive monitoring with visualizations

### Agentforce DX Implementation
- **Pro-Code Development**: CLI-based agent development
- **Version Control**: Git integration for agent metadata
- **CI/CD Integration**: Automated deployment pipelines
- **Enterprise Ready**: Production-grade development practices
- **Metadata Management**: Full Salesforce DX project structure

## The Agent Development Lifecycle

### Phase 1: Ideation & Design
**Purpose**: Define the agent's purpose, persona, and core capabilities.

**Python SDK Approach**:
- Interactive agent specification generation
- AI-powered topic generation
- Company and role definition
- Tone and personality configuration

**Agentforce DX Approach**:
- CLI-based agent specification creation
- YAML-based configuration
- Structured metadata generation
- Version-controlled specifications

### Phase 2: Development
**Purpose**: Transform specifications into functional agents with tools and knowledge base.

**Python SDK Approach**:
- Programmatic agent creation
- SDK-based configuration
- Automated metadata generation
- Interactive development environment

**Agentforce DX Approach**:
- CLI-based agent creation
- Metadata synchronization
- DX project integration
- Enterprise development practices

### Phase 3: Testing & Validation
**Purpose**: Comprehensive testing to validate behavior, security, and performance.

**Python SDK Approach**:
- Automated testing frameworks
- Performance benchmarking
- Security validation
- Integration testing

**Agentforce DX Approach**:
- CLI-based testing
- Metadata validation
- Deployment testing
- Quality assurance processes

### Phase 4: Deployment & Release
**Purpose**: Deploy agents to target environments with proper validation.

**Python SDK Approach**:
- Automated deployment scripts
- Environment management
- Release validation
- Rollback capabilities

**Agentforce DX Approach**:
- DX-based deployment
- Metadata deployment
- Environment promotion
- Release management

### Phase 5: Monitoring & Tuning
**Purpose**: Monitor performance and optimize based on real-world usage data.

**Python SDK Approach**:
- Real-time monitoring
- Performance analytics
- Automated optimization
- Visual dashboards

**Agentforce DX Approach**:
- Log monitoring
- Performance tracking
- Optimization recommendations
- Enterprise monitoring

## Quick Start

### Python SDK Implementation

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd agent-sdk-implementation
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Notebook**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook notebooks/ADLC_PythonSDK.ipynb
   ```

3. **Configure Credentials**
   - Update placeholder credentials in the notebook
   - Ensure you have agentforce-sdk access

### Agentforce DX Implementation

1. **Install Salesforce CLI**
   ```bash
   npm install -g @salesforce/cli
   sf update
   ```

2. **Create DX Project**
   ```bash
   sf project generate --name agentforcedx
   cd agentforcedx
   ```

3. **Authorize Org**
   ```bash
   sf org login web --alias agentforce --instance-url https://login.salesforce.com
   ```

4. **Follow the Complete Guide**
   - See `agent-sdk-implementation/ADLC_AFDX.md` for detailed implementation
