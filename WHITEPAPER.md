# Coral Cloud Resorts Agent Implementation

## Prerequisites
```bash
# Python 3.9+ required
python3 --version
pip3 install pyyaml agentforce-sdk

# Salesforce CLI required
sf --version
sf org list
```

> **Note**: Custom objects setup is detailed in [CUSTOM_OBJECTS_SETUP.md](CUSTOM_OBJECTS_SETUP.md)

## Phase 1: Ideation & Design

### 1. Agent Specification Creation
```bash
# Navigate to project
cd /Users/akshata.sawant/SF_ADLC_Whitepaper

# Install dependencies
pip3 install pyyaml

# Generate agent specification interactively
sf agent generate agent-spec

# When prompted, provide:
# - Type of agent: Customer
# - Company Name: Coral Cloud Resorts
# - Company Description: Coral Cloud Resorts provides customers with exceptional destination activities, unforgettable experiences, and reservation services, all backed by a commitment to top-notch customer service.
# - Role of the agent: The resort manager fields customer complaints, manages employee schedules, and generally makes sure everything is working smoothly.
```

## Phase 2: Development

### 1. Create Agent from Specification
```bash
# Create the agent using the spec file
sf agent create --spec specs/agentSpec.yaml --name "Resort Manager" --api-name Resort_Manager --target-org resorts-demo --preview
```

This will create a new Agent Resort Manager using Spec agentSpec.yaml and the preview can be viewed in .json file Resort_Manager_Preview<timestamp>.json

### 2. Custom Objects Setup
```bash
# Automated setup (recommended)
python3 setup_custom_objects.py

# Or see [CUSTOM_OBJECTS_SETUP.md](CUSTOM_OBJECTS_SETUP.md) for manual steps
```

This creates:
- Reservation__c object
- Activity__c object  
- Employee__c object

## Phase 3: Python SDK Implementation

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run Resort Manager Agent
```bash
# Run the main agent implementation
python3 resort_manager_agent.py

# Run demo scenarios
python3 demo_resort_agent.py
```

### 3. Agent Capabilities
- Customer Complaint Resolution with Salesforce integration
- Employee Schedule Management via API calls
- Reservation System Support with real-time data
- Activity Recommendations using RAG
- Service Quality Monitoring with knowledge base

## Success Criteria

### Phase 1 Complete
- ✅ Agent specification generated via `sf agent generate agent-spec`
- ✅ Files: `specs/agentSpec.yaml` created

### Phase 2 Complete
- ✅ Custom objects created successfully in Salesforce
- ✅ Objects accessible via Salesforce CLI
- ✅ Metadata deployment successful

### Phase 3 Complete
- ✅ Python SDK implementation with realistic APIs
- ✅ RAG integration for knowledge base
- ✅ Salesforce data integration working
- ✅ Agent ready for production deployment

## Key Files Generated
- `specs/agentSpec.yaml` - Agent specification
- `resort_manager_agent.py` - Main agent implementation
- `demo_resort_agent.py` - Demo scenarios
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `force-app/main/default/objects/` - Custom object metadata
- Custom objects deployed to Salesforce org

**All Phases Complete - Production-Ready Resort Manager Agent!**

## Testing Results

The agent implementation has been successfully tested and is working correctly:

1. **Custom Objects Created**: Reservation__c, Activity__c, Employee__c objects with all required fields
2. **Agent Functionality**: All 5 agent topics working correctly
3. **Salesforce Integration**: Real-time data queries and updates working
4. **RAG Knowledge Base**: Policy lookup and response generation working
5. **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of empty data scenarios

The agent is ready for production deployment and can handle real resort management scenarios.
